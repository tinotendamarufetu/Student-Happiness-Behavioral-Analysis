# Student-Happiness-Behavioral-Analysis
Understanding how students' routines, study intensity, and entertainment habits impact their happiness over three weeks of self-tracked data.

This project explores the relationship between students' daily routines, study habits, entertainment/leisure time, and their self-reported happiness levels.  
The data was collected over three different weeks through self-tracked schedule entries.

## Key Analyses
- Routine similarity score vs average happiness
- Entertainment time vs study time interaction effects
- Per-week breakdown of entertainment's impact on happiness
- Threshold analysis for low-study, high-entertainment students
- Non-linear modeling of study and entertainment behaviors

## Methods
- Multiple linear regression
- Interaction effect analysis
- Threshold-based hypothesis testing
- Per-week disaggregation
- Data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib

## Results Summary
- No strong evidence of an interaction effect between entertainment time and study time on happiness.
- Students' happiness remained relatively stable across different patterns of routine and entertainment.
- Mild week-by-week variations were observed but were not statistically significant.

## Technologies
- Python 3.11
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels
- Scipy
